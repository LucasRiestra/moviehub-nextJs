# MovieHub

MovieHub is a web application developed in Next.js that allows users to explore a variety of movies.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js directory structure:

- **pages/:** This directory contains all the pages of the application. Each file corresponds to a route based on its name.
- **public/:** This directory stores static files like images that can be referenced in the code.
- **styles/:** This directory contains global and component style files.
- **components/:** This directory contains reusable React components.
- **cypress/:** This directory contains end-to-end tests written with Cypress.
- **node_modules/:** This directory contains all the project dependencies installed via npm.

In addition to these, you may also see the following files and directories:

- **.next/:** This directory is generated when Next.js builds your application for production. It contains the compiled versions of your pages and other assets.
- **package.json:** This file contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
- **package-lock.json:** This file is automatically generated and describes the exact tree of dependencies that were installed for your project.
- **README.md:** This file contains information about the project, how to install it, and how to use it.

## Getting Started

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. **IMPORTANT:** Before running the project, make sure to first set up and run the backend project available at [https://github.com/LucasRiestra/Movie-Hub](https://github.com/LucasRiestra/Movie-Hub).
4. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
5. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
6. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Testing

This project uses Cypress for end-to-end testing. To run the tests, use the command `npx cypress run`.
